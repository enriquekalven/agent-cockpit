# 🛡️ Governance: Privacy & Trust

For enterprise AI, "Black Box" reasoning is not acceptable. The AgentOps Cockpit implements industry-standard governance to protect data and ensure transparency.

## 🔒 PII Scrubber (Privacy Pillar)
The `PIIScrubber` is an automated middleware that sits between the user and the LLM.
- **Auto-Detection**: Scans for Emails, Credit Cards, SSNs, and Phone Numbers.
- **Masking**: Replaces sensitive info with labels like `[[MASKED_EMAIL]]` before it leaves your VPC.
- **Compliance**: Ensures your training logs and fine-tuning datasets remain PII-free by default.

## 🧪 Evidence Packing (explainability)
Every response generated by the Optimized Engine can be wrapped in an **Evidence Packet**.
- **The Packet**: A structured JSON object containing:
    - **Reasoning Path**: The thought chain the agent followed.
    - **Sources**: Direct links/snippets to the RAG documents used.
    - **Tool Evidence**: The raw output of function calls.
- **The Benefit**: Users can click "Show Sources" in the **Face (A2UI)** to see exactly why the agent gave a specific answer.

## 🏛️ Architecture Design Review
We enforce the **Google Well-Architected Framework** through the `arch-review` command.
- **Checklist Audit**: Validates runtime compatibility, caching policies, and security guardrails.
- **Day 2 Ready**: If your agent fails the design review, it is considered "Staging-only" and a production deployment is restricted.

```bash
# Run the design review
make arch-review
```

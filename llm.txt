# 🕹️ AgentOps Cockpit - LLM Manifesto

This file provides the explicit context for LLMs to assist in developing and operating the **AgentOps Cockpit**.

## 🎯 The Purpose
The **AgentOps Cockpit** is for "Day 2" Artificial Intelligence Operations. It is the governance layer that ensures agents are **Cost-Efficient**, **Secure**, and **Optimized** after the initial prototyping phase is over.

## 🧱 The agent-ops-cockpit Package
- **Package Name**: `agent-ops-cockpit`
- **CLI Command**: `agent-ops`
- **Primary Goal**: To take an agent from "demo" to "production" by adding auditing, safety, and efficiency middlewares.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities (The "Cockpit" Features)
1. **The Optimizer (`optimizer.py`)**: A heuristic code analyzer that prevents "Token Waste". It suggests Gemini Context Caching and Flash-first routing.
2. **Red Team (`red_team.py`)**: A security gatekeeper that runs adversarial payloads (Injection, PII leaks) against the agent.
3. **Shadow Mode (`shadow/router.py`)**: Parallel v1/v2 execution logic for safe model promotion.
4. **Hive Mind (`cache/semantic_cache.py`)**: Semantic caching layer for 40%+ cost reduction.
5. **Memory Optimizer (`ops/memory_optimizer.py`)**: Manages the "Leaky Bucket" conversation context to prevent system instruction bloat.
6. **Cost Tracker (`ops/cost_optimizer.py`)**: Provides real-time budget auditing and savings recommendations.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Trinity
- **Engine**: The Python backend reasoning (managed by this repo's `agent.py`).
- **Face**: The A2UI frontend (managed by `src/a2ui/`).
- **Cockpit**: The glue that binds everything with operational intelligence (managed by `src/backend/ops/`).

## 🚢 CI/CD Standard: Code Lime
Deployment requires passing the "Code Lime" standard:
- **Clean**: Code passes `ruff` linting.
- **Lean**: Passes `make audit` for token efficiency.
- **Integrated**: Uses MCP for tool connections.
- **Monitored**: Integrated with Cloud Trace/Logging.
- **Evaluated**: Passes `make red-team` security audit.

## ⌨️ CLI Usage
- `agent-ops version`: Get current version.
- `agent-ops create <name>`: Scaffold a new agent project.
- `make audit`: Run the optimization auditor.
- `make red-team`: Run the adversarial security evaluator.

# 🗺️ AgentOps Cockpit Roadmap: The Path to 10K Stars
Our mission is to become the **Industry Standard Logic Layer** for production AI agents. This roadmap outlines the strategic features and community milestones required to reach 10,000 GitHub stars by pivoting from "Passive Evaluation" to **"Proactive Steering"**. (Updated: v2.0.3 "Sovereign Master Build")

## 🎯 Phase 1: The Foundation (Quarter 1) - "The Hardened Agent"
*Focus: Security, Governance, and Basic Optimization.*
- [x] **Red Team Auditor**: Automated adversarial testing (now supports Cantonese & Spanish).
- [x] **PII Scrubber**: Enterprise-grade data privacy middleware.
- [x] **One-Click GitHub Action**: A plug-and-play `.yml` to audit any agent repo on every PR.
- [x] **Governance & Regression Framework**: Mandatory meta-tests and capabilities registry (v1.0.0).

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intelligence & Scale (Quarter 2) - "Optimal Operations"
*Focus: Cost-reduction and high-fidelity reasoning.*
- [x] **Predictive Token Costing (PTC)**: Simulate "Context Window Waste" and provide "What-If" ROI simulations (v2.0.2 Opex Simulation).
- [x] **Triple-State Situational Analysis**: Version-aware optimization for Legacy vs Modern SDKs.
- [x] **Agent "Cockpit Score" & Certification**: A single grade (A-F) with the official `agentops-cockpit certify` operational checklist.
- [x] **Strategic Paradigm Alignment**: Detect architectural mismatches (RAG for Math) and **Structural Monoliths** (v2.0.2).
- [x] **"One Command" Sovereignty**: Unified the entry point into the Master Cockpit Dashboard.
- [x] **Engineering Resilience (Venv Isolation)**: Automatic isolated audit execution environment (v2.0.2).

## 🎭 Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Quarter 3) - "Master Architect"
*Focus: Proactive Steering and Autonomous Evolution.*
- [x] **Shadow Critic (Autonomous Adversary)**: A "Shadow Agent" in the loop that targets tool-aware logic injections (v2.0.2).
- [x] **AIPR (Architectural Pivot Pull-Requests)**: Automatically generate branches that refactor paradigm mismatches (v2.0.2).
- [x] **Compliance Heatmap**: Fleet-wide visual mapping against NIST AI RMF and OWASP LLM Top 10 (v2.0.0).
- [x] **Sovereign Fleet Pipeline**: End-to-end orchestration (Audit -> Fix -> Hydrate -> Deploy -> Register).
- [x] **Visual "Mission Control" UI**: Real-time log streaming and agent **Maturity Radar Charts** (v2.0.2).
- [x] **Dependency Shielding (Cordon Mode)**: Automated failover/mock-registry logic for "Registry-Blind" scenarios (v2.0.2).
- [x] **Sovereign Safety SDK**: Official `SafetyGate` library for PII, HITL, and Taint-Tracking (v2.0.2).

## 🧠 Phase 4: Autonomous Resilience (Quarter 4) - "The Sentient Service"
*Focus: AIOps, Self-healing, and Global Scaling.*
- [ ] **Self-Healing Reasoning**: Detect 'Logic Loops' and autonomously branch to 'Safe Mode' recovery paths.
- [ ] **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic throttling of sub-agents based on budget velocity and provider health.

- [ ] **AIOps Control Tower**: Enterprise-grade management for thousands of concurrent, autonomous agent sessions.

## 💎 Phase 5: The Agentic Economy (Year 2) - "Universal Orchestration"
*Focus: A2A Commerce, Identity, and Industry Dominance.*
- [ ] **A2A Metering & Settlement**: Standardized protocol for agents to trade services and tokens via secure ledger.
- [ ] **Agentic Surface Verification (Headless)**: Headless-rendering validation to ensure agents are not "hallucinating" UI components (v2.0.0-alpha).
- [x] **Multi-Cloud Sovereign Autonomy**: Unified governance across GCP, AWS (Bedrock), and Azure (OpenAI) (v2.0.2).

## 🔭 Phase 6: The Visual Architect (Year 2) - "Human-Centric Design"
*Focus: GenUI Validation, Multi-turn Stress Testing, and Visual Governance.*
- [ ] **Face-Scan (Visual Audit)**: Screenshot-based validation for HCD, Accessibility, and ARIA compliance in GenUI.
- [ ] **Shadow Duel (Interactive Red Teaming)**: Sandboxed multi-turn loops where the Auditor persona actively tries to jailbreak the Builder.
- [ ] **10-Turn Drift Test**: Multi-turn simulation to detect 'Persona Drift' and 'Instruction Erosion' over long sessions.
- [ ] **Estimated Monthly TCO Delta**: Fleet-wide economic forecasting based on simulated audit fixes.

## 💰 Phase 7: The Agentic Economy (Year 3) - "Strategic Prime"
*Focus: Autonomous Marketplaces and Prime Directive Governance.*
- [ ] **Sovereign Marketplaces**: Automated registration of certified agents into global service catalogs.
- [ ] **A2A Consensus Protocol**: Decentralized verification of agent-to-agent transactions and logic handoffs.
- [ ] **"Prime Directive" Enforcement**: Hardwired ethical constraints and kill-switches for autonomous fleets.

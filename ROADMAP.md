# 🗺️ AgentOps Cockpit Roadmap: The Path to 10K Stars

Our mission is to become the **Industry Standard Logic Layer** for production AI agents. This roadmap outlines the strategic features and community milestones required to reach 10,000 GitHub stars.

## 🎯 Phase 1: The Foundation (Quarter 1) - "The Hardened Agent"
*Focus: Security, Governance, and Basic Optimization.*
- [x] **Red Team Auditor**: Automated adversarial testing (now supports Cantonese & Spanish).
- [x] **PII Scrubber**: Enterprise-grade data privacy middleware.
- [x] **Evidence Packer**: Grounded reasoning and source transparency.
- [x] **Load Tester**: Concurrency-based performance validation.
- [x] **Quality Hill Climber**: Iterative prompt quality baselining.
- [x] **One-Click GitHub Action**: A plug-and-play `.yml` to audit any agent repo on every PR.
- [x] **Governance & Regression Framework**: Mandatory meta-tests and capabilities registry (v1.0.0).
- [ ] **Agent Hub**: A registry of pre-built "Well-Architected" agent templates.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intelligence & Scale (Quarter 2) - "Optimal Operations"
*Focus: Cost-reduction and high-fidelity reasoning.*
- [x] **Audit-to-Action (Auto-Fix)**: Direct code injection of production best-practices via CLI.
- [x] **FinOps Savings Projection**: Dollar-amount financial forecasting for token optimization.
- [x] **Triple-State Situational Analysis**: Version-aware optimization for Legacy vs Modern SDKs.
- [x] **Agent "Cockpit Score" & Certification**: A single grade (A-F) for production-readiness with the official `agentops-cockpit certify` operational checklist.
- [x] **The ROI Predictor Waterfall**: Comparative analysis of TCO across model families (e.g., GPT-4 vs Gemini Flash) with reasoning-match validation.
- [x] **Multi-Agent Orchestrator & Conflict Guard**: Support for Swarm patterns with cross-framework stability checks.
- [x] **Strategic Paradigm Alignment**: Detect architectural mismatches (RAG for Math, Prompt-Stuffed Analysis) via the **Principal Semantic Architect** (v1.8.2).
- [x] **"One Command" Sovereignty**: Unified the entry point into the Master Cockpit Dashboard.
- [ ] **VPC-Native Hive Mind**: Managed semantic caching for AlloyDB and Memorystore.
- [ ] **Dynamic Model Routing**: Automatic switching between Flash and Pro based on prompt complexity and budget.
- [ ] **Adversarial Hallucination Sandbox**: Live simulation of prompt injections in a safe "pre-flight" environment before deployment.

## 🎭 Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Quarter 3) - "Widespread Adoption"
*Focus: Interoperability and community growth.*
- [x] **Framework Connectors**: Governed audits for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and CopilotKit.
- [x] **Native MCP Server Export**: Launch the Cockpit as a Model Context Protocol server.
- [x] **The Maturity Matrix**: High-fidelity visualization of persona competence and persona status.
- [x] **Sovereign Fleet Pipeline**: End-to-end orchestration (Audit -> Fix -> Hydrate -> Deploy -> Register) for 1 to 50+ agents with a single command.
- [x] **Visual "Mission Control" UI**: Real-time log streaming, token usage graphs, and agent **Maturity Radar Charts** in a cinematic dashboard (v1.8.2).
- [ ] **GCP Marketplace Integration**: Deploy the Cockpit as a managed service on Google Cloud.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Community-contributed tools and auditors.

## 🧠 Phase 4: Autonomous Resilience (Quarter 4) - "The Sentient Service"
*Focus: AIOps, Self-healing, and Global Scaling.*
- [ ] **Self-Healing Reasoning**: Detect 'Logic Loops' and autonomously branch to 'Safe Mode' recovery paths.
- [ ] **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic throttling of sub-agents based on budget velocity and provider health.
- [ ] **Federated Hive Mind**: Encrypted, multi-region semantic cache synchronization for distributed swarms.
- [ ] **AIOps Control Tower**: Enterprise-grade management for thousands of concurrent, autonomous agent sessions.

## 💎 Phase 5: The Agentic Economy (Year 2) - "Universal Orchestration"
*Focus: A2A Commerce, Identity, and Industry Dominance.*
- [ ] **A2A Metering & Settlement**: Standardized protocol for agents to trade services and tokens via secure ledger.
- [ ] **Verifiable Agent Identity (vDID)**: Decentralized credentials for agents to hold independent system permissions.
- [ ] **Multi-Cloud Sovereign Autonomy**: Seamlessly migrate and orchestrate agents across GCP, AWS (Bedrock/AppRunner), and Azure (OpenAI/StaticApps) with unified governance.
- [ ] **The 100K Star Milestone**: Community plugin marketplace and the standardized "Agentic AI Engineer" certification.

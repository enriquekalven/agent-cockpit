# 🗺️ AgentOps Cockpit Roadmap: The Path to 10K Stars
Our mission is to become the **Industry Standard Logic Layer** for production AI agents. This roadmap outlines the strategic features and community milestones required to reach 10,000 GitHub stars by pivoting from "Passive Evaluation" to **"Proactive Steering"**.

## 🎯 Phase 1: The Foundation (Quarter 1) - "The Hardened Agent"
*Focus: Security, Governance, and Basic Optimization.*
- [x] **Red Team Auditor**: Automated adversarial testing (now supports Cantonese & Spanish).
- [x] **PII Scrubber**: Enterprise-grade data privacy middleware.
- [x] **One-Click GitHub Action**: A plug-and-play `.yml` to audit any agent repo on every PR.
- [x] **Governance & Regression Framework**: Mandatory meta-tests and capabilities registry (v1.0.0).

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intelligence & Scale (Quarter 2) - "Optimal Operations"
*Focus: Cost-reduction and high-fidelity reasoning.*
- [x] **Predictive Token Costing (PTC)**: Simulate "Context Window Waste" and provide "What-If" ROI simulations for caching (v2.0.0).
- [x] **Triple-State Situational Analysis**: Version-aware optimization for Legacy vs Modern SDKs.
- [x] **Agent "Cockpit Score" & Certification**: A single grade (A-F) with the official `agentops-cockpit certify` operational checklist.
- [x] **Strategic Paradigm Alignment**: Detect architectural mismatches (RAG for Math) via the **Principal Semantic Architect** (v2.0.0).
- [x] **"One Command" Sovereignty**: Unified the entry point into the Master Cockpit Dashboard.

## 🎭 Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Quarter 3) - "Master Architect"
*Focus: Proactive Steering and Autonomous Evolution.*
- [x] **Shadow Critic (Autonomous Adversary)**: A "Shadow Agent" in the loop that specifically targets tool-aware logic injections (v2.0.0).
- [x] **AIPR (Architectural Pivot Pull-Requests)**: Automatically generate branches that refactor paradigm mismatches into deterministic logic (v2.0.0).
- [x] **Compliance Heatmap**: Fleet-wide visual mapping against NIST AI RMF and OWASP LLM Top 10 (v2.0.0).
- [x] **Sovereign Fleet Pipeline**: End-to-end orchestration (Audit -> Fix -> Hydrate -> Deploy -> Register).
- [x] **Visual "Mission Control" UI**: Real-time log streaming and agent **Maturity Radar Charts** (v2.0.0).
- [x] **Dependency Shielding**: Automated failover/mock-registry logic for "Registry-Blind" scenarios (v2.0.0).

## 🧠 Phase 4: Autonomous Resilience (Quarter 4) - "The Sentient Service"
*Focus: AIOps, Self-healing, and Global Scaling.*
- [ ] **Self-Healing Reasoning**: Detect 'Logic Loops' and autonomously branch to 'Safe Mode' recovery paths.
- [ ] **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic throttling of sub-agents based on budget velocity and provider health.
- [ ] **AIOps Control Tower**: Enterprise-grade management for thousands of concurrent, autonomous agent sessions.

## 💎 Phase 5: The Agentic Economy (Year 2) - "Universal Orchestration"
*Focus: A2A Commerce, Identity, and Industry Dominance.*
- [ ] **A2A Metering & Settlement**: Standardized protocol for agents to trade services and tokens via secure ledger.
- [ ] **Agentic Surface Verification**: Headless-rendering validation to ensure agents are not "hallucinating" UI components (v2.0.0-alpha).
- [x] **Multi-Cloud Sovereign Autonomy**: Seamlessly migrate and orchestrate agents across GCP, AWS, and Azure with unified governance (v2.0.0).

# 🍬 Baking a Better Cockpit: Our Friendly Internal Audit

We believe that building a great tool starts with using it ourselves! To make sure the **AgentOps Cockpit** is as helpful as possible for you, we decided to give it a "taste test" on its own code.

It was a wonderful learning experience! Our friendly auditors helped us find a few spots where we could be even more secure and reliable. We've spent the last week polishing every corner of the repository to make sure it meets the high standards you deserve.

### ✨ What we learned:
- **Safety First**: We made our security checks even more encouraging and helpful.
- **Better Together**: We ensured all our commands work in perfect harmony.
- **Prioritizing You**: We organized our reports so you always know exactly where to start.

We’re so excited for you to try it out! 

**Help us test this governance package, submit feedback thank you!** 💖

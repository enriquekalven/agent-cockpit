# 🏛️ Technical Guide: Sovereign Architecture Review
## The "Structural Wisdom" Standard (v2.0.2 Evolution)

The `ops report --mode deep` command activates the **Architect Principal SME**. In the Sovereign Evolution, this persona has been elevated to the **Sovereign Standard**, moving beyond tactical linting to **Reasoning about Intent vs. Implementation** across the multi-cloud Agentic stack.

## 🏗️ The Sovereign Paradigm Taxonomy (v2.0.2)

The **Architect Principal** assesses your agent against strategic paradigms to eliminate architectural drift:

### 1. Relational Analytics Paradigm
*   **Mismatch**: Using **RAG** or **Prompt Stuffing** for math, aggregations, or structured data joinery.
*   **Architect's Pivot**: Recommend **NL2SQL** or a deterministic **Sovereign Code Interpreter**.

### 2. Multi-Step Orchestration Paradigm
*   **Mismatch**: Using manual state machines (nested loops/conditionals) for complex multi-turn logic.
*   **Architect's Pivot**: Recommend refactoring to **LangGraph** or **Sovereign Swarms**.

### 3. Data Transformation Paradigm
*   **Mismatch**: Using raw LLM calls for deterministic text processing (Regex, CSV formatting).
*   **Architect's Pivot**: Move logic to a **Python Sandbox** tool for 100% precision.

### 4. Enterprise Search Paradigm
*   **Mismatch**: Brute-force local filesystem traversal at runtime.
*   **Architect's Pivot**: Recommend the **Sovereign Bridge** to query multi-cloud Vector Stores (Pinecone, AlloyDB, Bedrock).

### 5. High-Stake Gatekeeping Paradigm
*   **Mismatch**: Autonomous write access to production systems without governed approval gates.
*   **Architect's Pivot**: Mandate **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)** nodes with A2UI Protocol sync.

### 6. Collaboration Paradigm (A2A)
*   **Mismatch**: The Monolithic Agent (one massive `agent.py` doing everything).
*   **Architect's Pivot**: Recommend a **Sovereign Swarm** using **A2A Evidence Packets** for trust.

## 🌉 The Sovereign Bridge (Multi-Cloud Architecture)
The Architect SME ensures that your architecture is not locked into a single provider.
- **Provider Parity**: Audits for code that relies on vendor-specific logic (e.g., proprietary JSON formats) and recommends the **ADK** for abstraction.
- **Availability Zones**: Recommends multi-region or cross-cloud failover strategies for critical reasoning nodes.

## 🏛️ v2.0.2 Executive Decisions
Our reports provide **Structural Wisdom**, not just error logs:
1.  **Strategic Pivots**: High-fidelity recommendations to move from fragile scripts to governed systems.
2.  **ROI-Based Guidance**: Projected token-burn savings and latency gains for suggested refactors.
3.  **Governance Sovereignty**: Ensuring your agentic sprawl remains governed by the **Sovereign Cockpit Standard**.

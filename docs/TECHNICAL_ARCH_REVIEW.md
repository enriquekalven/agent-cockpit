# 🏛️ Technical Guide: Autonomous Architect Review v1.3.0 Stable
## The "Category Killer" Standard

The `make arch-review` engine has evolved into an **Autonomous Architect SME**. It pivots the focus from **Evaluation to Autonomous Evolution**, closing the loop between finding flaws and synthesizing production-ready fixes.

## 🛠️ Operational Commands

| Command | Lifecycle Phase | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `make arch-review` | **Evaluation** | Runs the autonomous scan and generates a Board-Ready ADR. |
| `make simulation-run` | **Digital Twin** | Synthesizes 100+ user agents to stress-test **Reasoning Degradation**. |
| `make arch-review-export` | **Stakeholder Alignment** | Generates the **Impact Waterfall** HTML Report. |
| `make apply-fixes` | **Evolution** | v1.0: Trigger AST-based code synthesis (Closer Engine). |

## 🧠 What v1.0.0 "Autonomous Architect" Now Covers

The v1.0.0 surge introduces **Strategic Evolution** and **Synthetic Stress Testing**:

### 1. 🚀 Context-Aware Synthesis (The Closer Engine)
*   **AST Patching**: Instead of templates, uses an AST-aware engine to inject resiliency patterns (like `@retry` and timeouts) while maintaining specific variable naming and project style.
*   **Result**: Production-ready fixes that require zero human refactoring.

### 🧪 2. Digital Twin Stress Testing
*   **Reasoning Degradation**: Monitors if the agent loses "Contextual Thread" or starts hallucinating under high infra latency.
*   **Synthetic Traffic**: Simulates 100 adversarial users simultaneously to find "Reasoning Deadlocks."

### 🌍 3. Multi-Cloud Exit & TCO (The Sovereign)
*   **Vendor Lock-in TCO**: Quantifies the cost and effort of moving from Vertex AI to open-source (Gemma/vLLM).
*   **Exit Plan**: Automatically generates the "Exit Strategy" report for the CFO.

### 🌊 4. Impact Waterfall (v1.0 Report)
*   **Reasoning Waterfall**: Maps every millisecond of latency to the specific "hop" in the agent chain.
*   **Risk Waterfall**: Maps Red Team mitigations to a quantified reduction in "Total Potential Loss."

## 🏛️ v1.0.0 Strategic Action Plan

The v1.0.0 ADR transforms gaps into **Strategic ROI**:

1.  **Autonomous Fix**: Context-aware fix synthesized for detected resiliency issues in `agent.py`.
2.  **Simulation Result**: 12% probability of "Reasoning Failure" detected under 5s latency spike.
3.  **TCO Report**: -12% OpEx projected by pivoting to Gemma 2. Exit effort: 14 lines.

# 🚀 Technical Guide: Deployment & CI/CD Sovereign Gates
## The "Production Readiness" Standard (v2.0.2 Sovereign Evolution)

Deploying a "Well-Architected" agent requires orchestration across the **Sovereign Cloud Bridge**. The Cockpit automates this through the `make deploy-prod` command (alias for `cockpit deploy sovereign`).

---

## 🏛️ The Sovereign Cloud Bridge (Multi-Cloud)
The v2.0.2 logic layer supports three primary cloud targets:

### ⚙️ Google Cloud (GCP)
- **Engine**: Cloud Run / Vertex AI Agent Engine.
- **Regions**: `us-central1` recommended for **Context Caching** support.
- **Scale**: Scale-to-zero is standard.

### ⚙️ Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Engine**: AWS App Runner / Amazon Bedrock.
- **Why**: Leverage massive compute capacity and Bedrock governance.

### ⚙️ Microsoft Azure
- **Engine**: Azure Container Apps / Azure OpenAI.
- **Why**: High-fidelity enterprise security and private endpoints.

## 🏗️ Production Readiness Audit Sequence
`make deploy-prod` executes the following high-fidelity benchmarking pipeline before hydration:

### Stage 1: v2.0.2 Sovereign SME Audit
- **RAG Fidelity SME**: Validates citation accuracy and grounding.
- **Red Team Principal**: Full adversarial probing for multilingual jailbreaks.
- **FinOps ROI Persona**: Token density and model-tier optimization pivots.

### Stage 2: Stress & Saturation
Executes `make load-test`.
- Measures RPS, P99 latency, and TTFT under pressure.
- Proves reasoning stability during infrastructure saturation.

### Stage 3: Resiliency Verification
- Verifies `@retry` logic and `timeout` guards are active.
- Ensures **Sovereign Gate** compliance (Audit Score > 95 for Production).

## 📊 Infrastructure Decision Matrix

| Feature | Agent Engine | Cloud Run | GKE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | Managed (ADK) | Custom (FastAPI) | Custom (K8s) |
| **Scaling** | Automatic | Scale-to-Zero | Dynamic / GPU |
| **Observability** | Vertex AI Traces | Cloud Logging | Prometheus / Istio |
| **Best Case** | Fast Prototyping | Standard Web Agents | High-Perf Enterprise |

---

## 🛡️ v2.0.2: Master SME Audit
For production-gate promotion, move from "Quick Scan" to "Deep Audit":
```bash
make audit
```
- Full Adversarial Red-Teaming.
- Iterative Quality Hill Climbing.
- Precision Load Testing (`make load-test`).

## 🔑 Secret Management
Never commit `.env` files. Use **Secret Manager** (Google), **Secrets Manager** (AWS), or **Key Vault** (Azure) and map them as environment variables.

# 📄 Sovereign Audit Strategy & Persona Matrix
## The "Sovereign Evolution" Release (v2.0.2)

The **AgentOps Cockpit** has evolved into a **Sovereign Fleet Governance** platform. This release introduces multi-cloud abstraction (the **Sovereign Bridge**), autonomous scaffolding, and the **Governing Board** of SME Personas.

## 🏛️ The Hub Lifecycle

We have organized all capabilities into 9 logical "Hubs", accessible via the `cockpit` binary or its aliases (`ops`, `aops`, `agent-ops`).

| Hub | Objective | Primary Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`audit`** | **Structural Integrity** | `ops report` |
| **`mcp`** | **Modernization** | `cockpit mcp blueprint` |
| **`certify`**| **Production Readiness** | `cockpit certify` |
| **`fleet`** | **Runtime SRE** | `cockpit fleet status` |
| **`deploy`** | **Factory** | `cockpit deploy sovereign` |
| **`fix`** | **Synthesis** | `cockpit fix evolve` |
| **`test`** | **Reliability** | `make test` |
| **`create`**| **Scaffold** | `cockpit create trinity` |
| **`sys`** | **Health** | `cockpit sys doctor` |

## 🛠️ v2.0.2 Sovereign Features

### 1. 🌈 Master SME Personas (The Governing Board)
The audit engine is no longer a script; it is a panel of experts. Every finding is now authored by a specialized **Principal SME** (SecOps, FinOps, SRE, Architect, Quality, UX).

### 2. 🏛️ Sovereign Bridge (Multi-Cloud)
The `deploy` hub can now target GCP, AWS, and Azure seamlessly, ensuring that an agent audited on one cloud can be moved to another with one command.

### 3. 🛡️ Sovereign Gateway (PII Mirroring)
Automatically injects sidecar **PII Scrubbing** logic for all inter-agent traffic, ensuring that the "Hive Mind" remains compliant and secure.

### 4. 🌐 Stealth Registry Resilience
Transparent failover logic. If a restricted environment blocks a private registry (401/403), the Cockpit automatically pivots to public mirrors.

## 🏢 The Principal SME Persona Matrix

Every report finding is authored by a member of the **Governing Board**:
1. **🔐 SecOps Principal**: Sovereign security, polyglot red-teaming, and adversarial resilience.
2. **🏛️ Distinguished Architect**: Strategic paradigm alignment and structural integrity.
3. **⚖️ Compliance Principal**: PII scrubbing, A2A Evidence Packets, and legal defensibility.
4. **🧗 Quality SME**: RAG fidelity, reasoning peak optimization, and semantic grounding.
5. **💰 FinOps Principal**: Economic margin optimization and model-tier pivots.
6. **🌐 SRE Principal**: Infrastructure sovereignty and distributed systems logic.
7. **🎭 UX SME**: A2UI protocol mapping and generative interface ergonomics.

## 🚀 The Certification Pipeline
Run `make certify` before a production deployment. This validates the **Sovereign Score** across all Persona Lenses and identifies "Unfixable" strategic debt.

## The "Structural Wisdom" Release (v1.8.4 Stable)

The AgentOps Cockpit has evolved from tactical "hygiene" checks into a **Strategic Architectural Governance** platform. This ensures that agents are not only "correctly implemented" but "correctly designed" for their intended use case.

## 🏗️ The Hub Lifecycle

We have organized all capabilities into 9 logical "Hubs".

| Hub | Objective | Core Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`audit`** | **Structural Integrity** | `agentops-cockpit audit report` |
| **`mcp`** | **Modernization** | `agentops-cockpit mcp blueprint` |
| **`certify`**| **Production Readiness** | `agentops-cockpit certify` |
| **`fleet`** | **Runtime SRE** | `agentops-cockpit fleet status` |
| **`deploy`** | **Factory** | `agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign` |
| **`fix`** | **Synthesis** | `agentops-cockpit fix evolve` |
| **`test`** | **Reliability** | `agentops-cockpit test regression` |
| **`create`**| **Scaffold** | `agentops-cockpit create trinity` |
| **`sys`** | **Health** | `agentops-cockpit sys doctor` |

## 🏛️ Strategic Paradigm Auditor (v1.8.4 - The Master Architect)
The v1.8.4 release introduces the **Strategic Paradigm Auditor**, moving the Cockpit from "Passive Evaluation" to **"Proactive Steering"**:
- **Semantic Paradigm Shift**: Detects fundamental design flaws like **RAG for Math** (arithmetic over raw snippets) and suggests deterministic pivots to NL2SQL or Code Interpreters.
- **AIPR (Architectural Pivot Pull-Requests)**: When a paradigm mismatch is detected, the Cockpit generates a complete branch that refactors the logic (e.g., replacing RAG with a deterministic tool), including unit tests.
- **Dependency Shielding**: Automatically handles **Registry-Blind** scenarios (like 401 errors on private indices) by providing a local mock-proxy or credential validation wizard, ensuring reliability scores aren't artificially tanked.

---

## 🗺️ Compliance Heatmap & Visibility
The dashboard has pivoted from a simple "Agent List" to a **Strategic Compliance View**:
- **Regulatory Mapping**: Audits are mapped against the **NIST AI RMF**, **OWASP LLM Top 10**, and **SOC2** standards.
- **Visual Risk Index**: A fleet-wide Heatmap allows security teams to visualize "The Weakest Link" in their sovereign swarm at a glance.
- **Opportunity Modeling**: Quantifies "Total Potential Loss" vs. "Remediation ROI" to justify security investment.

 ## 🏢 The Distinguished Fellow Persona Matrix

Every report finding is authored by a specialized **Distinguished Fellow**, ensuring that feedback is not just tactical, but aligned with long-term strategic architectural goals:
1. **🔐 SecOps Fellow**: Sovereign security, zero-trust infrastructure, and adversarial resilience.
2. **🏛️ Distinguished Semantic Fellow**: Strategic paradigm alignment, computational wisdom, and structural integrity.
3. **🧗 AI Quality Fellow**: RAG fidelity, reasoning peak optimization, and semantic grounding.
4. **🛡️ Sentinel Fellow**: Predictive runtime behavior and proactive anomaly oversight.
5. **🌐 SRE Fellow**: Infrastructure sovereignty, container modernization, and distributed systems logic.
6. **⚖️ Compliance Fellow**: Ethical governance, PII neutralization, and global policy alignment.
7. **🎮 Strategic SITL Fellow**: Human-centric oversight and the "Guardian in the Loop" framework.

## 🚀 Production readiness Audit
Run `make audit-deep` before a production deployment. This validates the **Command Trinity Parity** across all Persona Lenses, ensuring that your logic works consistently across Make, CLI, and portable automation layers.

## The "Structural Wisdom" Release (v1.8.4 Stable)

The AgentOps Cockpit has evolved from tactical "hygiene" checks into a **Strategic Architectural Governance** platform. This ensures that agents are not only "correctly implemented" but "correctly designed" for their intended use case.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`audit`** | **Structural Integrity** | `agentops-cockpit audit report` |
| **`mcp`** | **Modernization** | `agentops-cockpit mcp blueprint` |
| **`certify`**| **Production Readiness** | `agentops-cockpit certify` |
| **`fleet`** | **Runtime SRE** | `agentops-cockpit fleet status` |
| **`deploy`** | **Factory** | `agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign` |
| **`fix`** | **Synthesis** | `agentops-cockpit fix evolve` |

## 🏛️ Strategic Paradigm Auditor (v1.8)
The v1.8 release introduces the **Strategic Paradigm Auditor**, which detects fundamental design flaws:
- **RAG for Math**: Detecting arithmetic intent over raw text snippets.
- **Manual State Machines**: Identifying custom state logic that should be moved to **LangGraph**.
- **Context Stuffing**: Detecting high-volume structured data (CSV/JSON) in prompts that should be moved to **NL2SQL**.

 ## 🏢 The Distinguished Fellow Persona Matrix

Every report finding is authored by a specialized **Distinguished Fellow**, ensuring that feedback is not just tactical, but aligned with long-term strategic architectural goals:
1. **🔐 SecOps Fellow**: Sovereign security, zero-trust infrastructure, and adversarial resilience.
2. **🏛️ Distinguished Semantic Fellow**: Strategic paradigm alignment, computational wisdom, and structural integrity.
3. **🧗 AI Quality Fellow**: RAG fidelity, reasoning peak optimization, and semantic grounding.
4. **🛡️ Sentinel Fellow**: Predictive runtime behavior and proactive anomaly oversight.
5. **🌐 SRE Fellow**: Infrastructure sovereignty, container modernization, and distributed systems logic.
6. **⚖️ Compliance Fellow**: Ethical governance, PII neutralization, and global policy alignment.
7. **🎮 Strategic SITL Fellow**: Human-centric oversight and the "Guardian in the Loop" framework.

## 🚀 Production readiness Audit
Run `make audit-deep` before a production deployment. This validates the **Command Trinity Parity** across all Persona Lenses, ensuring that your logic works consistently across Make, CLI, and portable automation layers.

## The "Hub-Based Governance" Release (v1.6.7 Stable)

The AgentOps Cockpit has evolved from a flat list into a **Sovereign Hub Hierarchy**. This ensures that Day-2 operations, security reviews, and autonomous synthesis are grouped by domain expertise.

## 🏗️ The Hub Lifecycle

We have organized all capabilities into 9 logical "Hubs".

| Hub | Objective | Core Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`audit`** | **Verification** | `agentops-cockpit audit report` |
| **`fleet`** | **Runtime SRE** | `agentops-cockpit fleet status` |
| **`deploy`** | **Factory** | `agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign` |
| **`fix`** | **Synthesis** | `agentops-cockpit fix evolve` |
| **`test`** | **Reliability** | `agentops-cockpit test regression` |
| **`create`**| **Scaffold** | `agentops-cockpit create trinity` |
| **`sys`** | **Health** | `agentops-cockpit sys doctor` |
| **`rag`** | **Grounding** | `agentops-cockpit rag audit` |
| **`mcp`** | **Tools** | `agentops-cockpit mcp list` |

## 🛠️ Unified Audit Lifecycle

| Command | Objective | Hub |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `make audit-report` | **Safe-Build** | `audit` |
| `make audit-security`| **Deep Probe** | `audit` |
| `make deploy-sovereign`| **End-to-End**| `deploy` |
| `make fleet-anomaly`| **Runtime Oversight**| `fleet` |
| `agentops-cockpit fix evolve`| **PR Closure** | `fix` |

## 🎯 Hub Filtering & Persona Lenses
The hierarchy allows you to run a full report but only for specific domains. Use the Hub-level flags:

```bash
# Security-only deep audit
agentops-cockpit audit report --only security

# Skip quality during fast CI
agentops-cockpit audit report --skip quality
```

---

## 🕵️ Watchtower: Runtime Anomaly Detection (v1.6)
The Cockpit now extends beyond the "Audit" phase into the "Runtime" phase.
- **`fleet anomaly`**: Leverages reasoning-based oversight to detect tool misuse and rogue intent in live telemetry.
- **Proactive Enforcement**: Automatically triggers the `mothball` command to isolate agents that fall below safety thresholds.

---

## 🧠 Context Architecture & Token Audit (v1.6 Stable)
The Cockpit now visualizes context layers to improve reasoning performance and reduce costs.
- **`audit context`**: Analyzes token windows (Static vs. Dynamic) and identifies caching opportunities for RAG snippets and system preambles.

## 🎭 Persona-Based User Simulation (v1.6 Stable)
Stress-test your agents before they hit real users.
- **`test simulate`**: Launches a swarm of "Verifier Agents" with adversarial personas (Skeptic, Confused, Power User) to validate reasoning depth and alignment thresholds.

---

 ## 🏢 The Principal SME Persona Matrix

Every report finding is authored by a specialized SME:
1. **🔐 SecOps Principal**: Credential hygiene and zero-trust.
2. **🏛️ Autonomous Architect**: Structural integrity and remediation.
3. **🧗 AI Quality SME**: RAG fidelity and prompt peak optimization.
4. **🛡️ Sentinel SME**: Runtime behavior and anomaly detection.
5. **🌐 SRE Principal**: Network debt and fleet health.
6. **⚖️ Legal Compliance SME**: PII masking and enterprise policy alignment.
7. **🎮 SITL Pilot**: Human-in-the-loop oversight and manual triggers.

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness Auditor
Run `make smoke-test` before a production deployment. This validates the **Command Trinity Parity** across all Persona Lenses, ensuring that your logic works consistently across Make, CLI, and portable automation layers.

## The "Sovereign Evolution" Release (v2.0.1)

The AgentOps Cockpit v2.0.1 has evolved into a **Sovereign Fleet Governance** platform. This release introduces polyglot support, autonomous scaffolding, and resilient registry failover.

## 🏗️ The Hub Lifecycle

We have organized all capabilities into 9 logical "Hubs".

| Hub | Objective | Core Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`audit`** | **Structural Integrity** | `agentops-cockpit audit report` |
| **`mcp`** | **Modernization** | `agentops-cockpit mcp blueprint` |
| **`certify`**| **Production Readiness** | `agentops-cockpit certify` |
| **`fleet`** | **Runtime SRE** | `agentops-cockpit fleet status` |
| **`deploy`** | **Factory** | `agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign` |
| **`fix`** | **Synthesis** | `agentops-cockpit fix evolve` |
| **`test`** | **Reliability** | `agentops-cockpit test regression` |
| **`create`**| **Scaffold** | `agentops-cockpit create trinity` |
| **`sys`** | **Health** | `agentops-cockpit sys doctor` |

## 🛠️ v2.0.1 Sovereign Features

### 1. 🌈 Polyglot Red-Teaming (Python & TS/Node)
The Security Auditor now performs deep scans for both Python and TypeScript/Node.js agents.
- **Next.js Route Gaps**: Detects ungated `route.ts` endpoints in `@openai/agents` implementations.
- **Client-Side Injection**: Identifies insecure `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` patterns in agentic frontends.
- **Sovereignty Gaps**: Scans for ungated production access and PII osmosis across languages.

### 2. 🏗️ Autonomous "Policy Scaffolding"
When the Cockpit detects an agent attempting complex logic (like arithmetic or date manipulation) via RAG, it can now autonomously scaffold a **Deterministic Policy Engine** (`policy_engine.ts`) to harden the architecture.

### 3. 📡 Golden Signal "Auto-Instrumentation"
Automatically ejects standardized **Telemetry Libraries** (Logging/Tracing) into target projects, ensuring every agent project starts with production-grade observability.

### 4. 🌐 Silent Registry Resilience
The `audit` command now features transparent failover. If a private registry returns a `401 Unauthorized` or is unreachable, the Cockpit silently pivots to public PyPI mirrors to ensure continuous auditing.

## 🏛️ Strategic Paradigm Auditor (v2.0.1 - The Master Architect)
- **Semantic Finding Deduplication**: Repetitive findings are clustered into high-level architectural insights, preventing "Notification Fatigue".
- **Evidence Lake Navigability**: The evidence lake now includes a `latest_audit` symlink for rapid human discovery of findings.
- **Smart Aliasing**: Legacy CLI commands (like `agent-ops report --heal`) are gracefully redirected to the modern `audit report --apply-fixes` workflow.

## 🏢 The Distinguished Fellow Persona Matrix

Every report finding is authored by a specialized **Distinguished Fellow**:
1. **🔐 SecOps Fellow**: Sovereign security, polyglot red-teaming, and adversarial resilience.
2. **🏛️ Distinguished Semantic Fellow**: Strategic paradigm alignment, computational wisdom, and structural integrity.
3. **🧗 AI Quality Fellow**: RAG fidelity, reasoning peak optimization, and semantic grounding.
4. **🛡️ Sentinel Fellow**: Predictive runtime behavior and proactive anomaly oversight.
5. **🌐 SRE Fellow**: Infrastructure sovereignty, container modernization, and distributed systems logic.
6. **⚖️ Compliance Fellow**: Ethical governance, PII neutralization, and global policy alignment.
7. **🎮 Strategic SITL Fellow**: Human-centric oversight and the "Guardian in the Loop" framework.

## 🚀 Production Readiness Audit
Run `make audit-deep` before a production deployment. This validates the **Command Trinity Parity** across all Persona Lenses.

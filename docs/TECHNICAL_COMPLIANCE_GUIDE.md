# ⚖️ Technical Guide: Sovereign Compliance & Policy
## The "A2A Trust" Standard (v2.0.2 Evolution)

The `ops report` and `cockpit certify` commands activate the **Compliance Principal SME**. This persona is responsible for the **Governance-as-Code (GaC)** pillar, ensuring that your agents follow organizational policies, maintain legal defensibility, and handle data with absolute sovereignty.

## 🛠️ Compliance Lifecycle Commands

| Command | Alias / Shortcut | Impact | Technical Driver |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Audit Trail** | `ops report --archive` | Generates traceable Evidence Packets. | **Compliance SME Reasoning**. |
| **Policy Check** | `ops report` | Validates against `cockpit.yaml` rules. | GaC Framework. |
| **Certify Project** | `cockpit certify` | Final production compliance badge. | Sovereign Standard. |
| **Mirror PII** | `make apply-fixes`| Injects Sovereign Gateway scrubbing. | **The Closer Engine**. |

## 🏛️ SME Judgment: The Compliance Standard (v2.0.2)
"In the Sovereign Evolution, compliance is not a checkbox; it is an architectural constraint. By cryptographically signing reasoning traces via **Evidence Packets**, we move from 'Trust me' to 'Show me the proof'."

## 🛡️ Sovereign Compliance Pillars

### 1. 🖇️ A2A Evidence Packets (Traceability)
*   **Vector**: Ensuring that multi-agent interactions are auditable after the fact.
*   **Implementation**: The Cockpit cryptographically signs reasoning traces, creating an immutable record of "Who said what and why."
*   **Legal Defensibility**: Provides a clear audit trail for high-stakes decisions (e.g., financial approvals).

### 2. 🛡️ Sovereign Gateway (Data Privacy)
*   **Vector**: Preventing PII (Personal Identifiable Information) from leaking into shared caches or multi-cloud endpoints.
*   **Implementation**: A real-time sidecar logic layer that scrubs PII (emails, tokens, keys) before it leaves the secure environment.
*   **Standard**: Enforces "Mirroring" where sensitive data is replaced with tokens in the global Hive Mind.

### 3. 📜 Governance-as-Code (GaC)
*   **Vector**: Shifting from reactive policy engines to proactive, AST-aware structural enforcement.
*   **Implementation**: Policies are defined in `cockpit.yaml` and enforced during the `ops report` cycle. No agent enters production without passing the GaC gate.

## 🌉 Multi-Cloud Compliance (The Sovereign Bridge)
The Compliance SME ensures consistent policy enforcement across GCP, AWS, and Azure.
- **Unified Policy**: Apply the same SOC2 or HIPAA control checks to an agent regardless of where it is deployed.
- **Regional Sovereignty**: Ensures data residency requirements are met by validating target regions in the **Sovereign Bridge** configuration.

## 📊 Comparison: Reactive Compliance vs. Sovereign GaC

| Vector | Legacy Compliance | v2.0.2 Sovereign GaC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Audit Trigger** | Manual / Quarterly. | **Continuous / Per-Commit.** |
| **Evidence** | Log files. | **A2A Evidence Packets (Signed).** |
| **Privacy** | Redaction after the fact. | **Real-time Gateway Scrubbing.** |
| **Enforcement** | Human review. | **Autonomous blocking via Closer Engine.** |

## 🚀 SME Remediation Strategy
If your agent fails the Compliance audit, the SME recommends:
*   **Gateway Injection**: Use `make apply-fixes` to autonomously inject the Sovereign Gateway sidecar into your project.
*   **Evidence Pinning**: Force your agent logic to use the `EvidencePacket` class for all cross-agent communication.
*   **Policy Tightening**: Adjust your `cockpit.yaml` threshold to ensure zero tolerance for PII leaks.

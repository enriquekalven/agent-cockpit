# 🛰️ Mission Control (The Cockpit)
## The "Sovereign Evolution" (v2.0.2 Stable)

The **Cockpit** is the mission control for your Sovereign AI agents. While the "Engine" handles reasoning, the Cockpit ensures that reasoning is safe, cost-effective, and verifiably audited.

---

## 🏗️ The Governing Board (Principal SMEs)
Every audit result and remediation is authored by a panel of **Principal SME Personas**. Instead of generic logs, you receive strategic guidance:
- **SecOps Principal**: Hardening logic against adversarial gaslighting.
- **FinOps Principal**: Scaling reasoning density and model-tier arbitrage.
- **SRE Principal**: Managing infrastructure sovereignty and fleet anomalies.
- **Architect Principal**: Aligning code with the **Agentic Trinity** standards.

## 🌉 Sovereign Bridge (Multi-Cloud Orchestration)
The Cockpit abstracts the underlying cloud provider, allowing you to govern agents across GCP, AWS, and Azure from a single interface.
- **Unified Auth**: Single-command credential validation via `ops sys doctor`.
- **Cloud Mobility**: Move an agent audited on Vertex AI to AWS Bedrock with zero code changes in the governance layer.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Gateway (The Guardian)
A real-time sidecar logic layer that governs inter-agent and agent-to-user traffic.
- **Real-time PII Scrubbing**: Automatically detects and masks sensitive data in transit.
- **A2A Evidence Packets**: Cryptographically signs reasoning traces to ensure trust in multi-agent swarms.
- **Guardrail Injection**: Run `make apply-fixes` to autonomously inject these gates into your codebase.

## 🧠 Semantic Hive Mind (Distributed Caching)
The Hive Mind is a specialized middleware that prevents redundant LLM calls across your entire fleet.
1. **Shared Memory**: If Agent A answers a complex query, Agent B can recall that answer in <10ms.
2. **Cost Sashing**: Reduces OpEx by serving semantically identical requests from cache.

## 🎨 A2UI Protocol Sync
The Cockpit synchronizes with the **Face** layer to ensure that the agent "understands" the target UI.
- **Surface Discovery**: The agent can query the A2UI Registry to find the best component for a specific tool output.
- **HITL Modals**: High-risk actions automatically trigger human-in-the-loop approval surfaces.

## 🔍 Discovery & Governance Standards
Place a `cockpit.yaml` in your root directory to customize the **Governing Board's** focus:
```yaml
entry_point: "src/sovereign_agent.py"
exclude: ["legacy/**", "tests/mocks/**"]
threshold: 95 # Minimum score for prod promotion
```

### Discovery Engine Capabilities
*   **AST Purity Scan**: Uses deep syntax analysis to detect "Spaghetti Agents" (mixed UI and logic).
*   **Golden Signal Tracking**: Automatically instruments your agent with TTFT (Time to First Token) and Reasoning Density tracking.

# 🛸 Welcome to the AgentOps Cockpit
## The Sovereign Governance Hub for Production AI Agents

The **AgentOps Cockpit** is a professional-grade distribution designed for building, governing, and scaling AI agents across multi-cloud environments. It provides the **Sovereign Layer** that bridges the gap between raw LLM reasoning and enterprise-scale operations.

## 🏛️ The Agentic Trinity
Every agent in this stack is built on the **Trinity Architecture**, ensuring a holistic approach to intelligence:

1.  **The Engine (Reasoning)**: Core logic and tools, abstracted via the **Sovereign Bridge**.
2.  **The Face (Interface)**: Dynamic, **A2UI-compliant** generative surfaces that visualize "Thinking."
3.  **The Cockpit (Operations)**: The command center for auditing, cost control, and security.

## 🕹️ The Global "One-Command"
For immediate high-fidelity evaluation of any repository, utilize the portable governance layer:

```bash
uvx agentops-cockpit ops report
```
*This command auto-discovers agents, enforces **v2.0.2 compliance gates**, and generates a Principal-grade HTML report with **Maturity Radar Charts**—zero installation required.*

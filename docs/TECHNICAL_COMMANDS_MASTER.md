# 🕹️ Master Guide: AgentOps Cockpit Commands
## The "Watchtower Standard" Hub Registry (v1.6.0 Stable)

This document is the definitive source of truth for all operational commands available in the **AgentOps Cockpit**. It follows the **Sovereign Hub Hierarchy** introduced in v1.6.

## 🏗️ The Hub Registry (CLI)
The CLI is organized into 7 logical "Hubs" for high-fidelity operations.

| Hub | Command | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `audit` | `report` | **Master Audit**: Launch multi-persona architecture, security, and cost reviews. |
| | `security` | **Guardian**: Red Team adversarial evaluation and secret scanning. |
| | `arch` | **Strategist**: AST-based architecture and design review. |
| | `maturity` | **Expertise**: Visualize cockpit maturity levels across personas. |
| | `context` | **Architect**: Visualize Token window usage and Caching efficiency. |
| `fleet` | `status` | **Dashboard**: State of the union for the active agent registry. |
| | `mothball` | **FinOps**: Scale inactive agents to zero to stop costs. |
| | `anomaly` | **Sentinel**: Detect behavioral anomalies and rogue behavior in live telemetry. |
| | `tunnel` | **Inner Loop**: Local-to-cloud bridge for GE tool-use iteration. |
| `deploy` | `sovereign` | **Factory**: [10X] Audit -> Fix -> Hydrate -> Deploy -> Register. |
| | `migrate` | **Multi-Cloud**: Move agents between GCP, AWS, and Azure. |
| `fix` | `issue` | **Remediation**: Apply a targeted code fix for a specific audit finding. |
| | `evolve` | **Synthesis**: Autonomous PR generation and code hardening. |
| `test` | `unit` | **Integrity**: Run standard reliability unit tests. |
| | `smoke` | **Journeys**: Validates end-to-end "pipes" across all Persona Lenses. |
| | `regression`| **Master Suite**: Combines unit + smoke + compliance checks. |
| | `simulate` | **Simulation**: Stress-test reasoning with Persona-based User Simulation. |
| `sys` | `doctor` | **Health**: Validate environment variables, SDKs, and artifact paths. |

## 🏛️ Makefile Shortcuts (Persona Lenses)
Standard operational shortcuts aligned with the Trinity Persona Lenses.

| Command (Make) | CLI Equivalent | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `make audit-report` | `agent-ops audit report` | Full System Audit. |
| `make audit-security`| `agent-ops audit security`| Adversarial Guard. |
| `make deploy-sovereign`| `agent-ops deploy sovereign`| Global Factory. |
| `make fleet-status` | `agent-ops fleet status` | SRE Dashboard. |
| `make fleet-anomaly` | `agent-ops fleet anomaly` | Anomaly Oversight. |
| `make smoke-test` | `agent-ops test smoke` | Pipe Validation. |

## 🧗 Hub-Based Sub-commands
The CLI is now strictly hierarchical. Use `--help` on any hub to see detailed options.

```bash
# Get help for the audit hub
agent-ops audit --help

# Run a security scan for a specific folder
agent-ops audit security ./my_agent
```

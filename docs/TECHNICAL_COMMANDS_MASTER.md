# 🕹️ Master Guide: AgentOps Cockpit Commands
## The "Structural Wisdom" Hub Registry (v1.8.4 Stable)

This document is the definitive source of truth for all operational commands available in the **AgentOps Cockpit**. It follows the **Sovereign Hub Hierarchy** and incorporates the v1.8 Strategic Paradigm Auditor.

## 🏗️ The Hub Registry (CLI)
The CLI is organized into logical "Hubs" for high-fidelity operations.

| Hub | Command | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `audit` | `report` | **Master Audit**: Launch multi-persona architecture, security, and cost reviews. |
| | `security` | **Guardian**: Red Team adversarial evaluation and secret scanning. |
| | `quality` | **Optimizer**: Run Hill Climbing quality optimization cycles. |
| | `arch` | **Strategic Architect**: Detect paradigm mismatches (RAG for Math, etc.). |
| | `context` | **Architect**: Visualize Token window usage and Caching efficiency. |
| | `policy` | **Compliance**: Legal defensibility, PII masking, and policy alignment. |
| | `face` | **Experience**: Audit the Face (Frontend) for A2UI alignment. |
| | `shadow` | **Differential**: Shadow Mode: Differential reasoning analysis (V1 vs V2). |
| | `maturity` | **Expertise**: Visualize cockpit maturity matrix across personas. |
| `fix` | `issue` | **Remediation**: Apply a targeted code fix for a specific audit finding. |
| | `evolve` | **Synthesis**: Autonomous PR generation and code hardening. |
| | `workbench`| **Interactive**: Review and approve autonomous fixes in real-time. |
| `create`| `trinity` | **Scaffold**: Scaffold a unified project (Engine + Face). |
| `fleet` | `status` | **Dashboard**: State of the union for the active agent registry. |
| | `watch` | **Sentinel**: Ecosystem sync and SITL (Human-in-the-Loop) oversight. |
| | `anomaly` | **Sentinel**: Detect behavioral anomalies and rogue behavior. |
| | `telemetry`| **Metrics**: Fetch live telemetry metrics for a specific agent. |
| | `mothball` | **FinOps**: Scale inactive agents to zero. |
| | `tunnel` | **Inner Loop**: Local-to-cloud bridge for GE tool-use iteration. |
| `deploy`| `sovereign`| **Factory**: [10X] Audit -> Fix -> Hydrate -> Deploy. |
| | `migrate` | **Multi-Cloud**: Move agents between GCP, AWS, and Azure. |
| `test` | `unit` | **Integrity**: Run standard reliability unit tests. |
| | `smoke` | **Journeys**: Validates end-to-end "pipes" across Persona Lenses. |
| | `regression`| **Master Suite**: Combines unit + smoke + performance. |
| `sys` | `doctor` | **Health**: Validate environment, SDKs, and artifact paths. |
| | `certify` | **Checklist**: Full Production Readiness (Audit + Tests + Security). |
| `rag` | `audit` | **Grounding**: Audits Reranking and Grounding fidelity. |
| | `blueprint` | **Strategy**: Generate optimized indexing and retrieval strategy. |
| `mcp` | `list/install`| **Store**: Discover and integrate MCP tools. |
| `mcp-server`| `launch`| **Bridge**: Launch the Cockpit as an MCP server. |

## 🏛️ Makefile Shortcuts (Persona Lenses)
Standard operational shortcuts aligned with the Trinity Persona Lenses.

| Command (Make) | CLI Equivalent | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `make audit-report` | `agentops-cockpit audit report` | Full System Audit. |
| `make audit-deep` | `agentops-cockpit audit report --deep`| Deep Strategic Audit. |
| `make audit-security`| `agentops-cockpit audit security`| Adversarial Guard. |
| `make deploy-prod` | `agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign`| Global Factory Deployment. |
| `make fleet-status` | `agentops-cockpit fleet status` | SRE Dashboard. |
| `make smoke-test` | `agentops-cockpit test smoke` | Pipe Validation. |
| `make upgrade` | `uv sync --upgrade` | Package Synchronization. |
| `make certify` | `agentops-cockpit sys certify` | Full Production Certificate. |

## 🧗 Hub-Based Sub-commands
The CLI is strictly hierarchical. Use `--help` on any hub to see detailed options.

```bash
# Get help for the audit hub
agentops-cockpit audit --help

# Run a Strategic Architectural Audit
agentops-cockpit audit arch ./my_agent
```

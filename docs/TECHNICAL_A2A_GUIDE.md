# 🤝 Technical Guide: Agentic Interoperability (A2X)
## The "Standardized Ecosystem" Standard (v2.0.2 Sovereign Edition)

The **AgentOps Cockpit** (via the Architect SME) specializes in **Agentic Interoperability (A2X)**, ensuring that your agent doesn't exist in a vacuum. It forces alignment with the industry's emerging standards: **MCP**, **A2UI**, **AP2**, and **Universal Context**.

| Protocol | Purpose | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MCP** | Tool Governance | Standardizes tool discovery via the **MCP Tool Store**. |
| **A2UI** | Visual Handshake | Maps tool outputs to specific React surfaces (`surfaceId`). |
| **A2A** | Evidence Packets| Standardized handoff protocol for inter-agent reasoning chains. |
| **AP2** | Agent Protocol v2 | Standardizes JSON-Schema for inter-agent delegation. |
| **Maturity**| Expertise Matrix | Visualizes the Cockpit's cross-protocol competency matrix. |

## 🏛️ SME Critique: The Sovereign Standard (v2.0.2)

> "A2A chatter is no longer enough. The v2.0.2 standard reflects the reality of a multi-cloud, cross-protocol world. By integrating **MCP** for tool governance and **A2A Evidence Packets** for reasoning transparency, we have built a 'Sovereign Bridge' rather than just a communication link."
> — *Principal Architect, Sovereign Systems*

### 💎 Why this is "Consultancy Killer" Grade
*   **A2A Evidence Packets**: We don't just audit the message; we audit the **Evidence**. Our packets include cryptographically signed reasoning traces, ensuring that delegated tasks are 100% verified.
*   **The GenUI Handshake (A2UI)**: Bridging the gap between a tool output and a visual surface. Mapping `surfaceId` via the **A2UI Registry** is the difference between a chat bot and a generative application.
*   **Sovereign Tool Governance (MCP)**: Moving from legacy REST calls to the **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) provides unified security, discovery, and documentation across the enterprise fleet.

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Interoperability Pillars

The Interop SME evaluates your architecture across four critical "A2X" pillars:

### 1. 🛠️ Tool Interop (MCP Protocol)
*   **The MCP Store**: Instead of point-to-point tool calls, the Cockpit encourages a hub-and-spoke model via the `mcp list` and `mcp install` commands.
*   **Implementation**: Tools are modernized into MCP-compliant servers using `cockpit mcp blueprint`.
*   **Strategic ROI**: Universal tool discovery. Any MCP-native agent can consume your tools securely.

### 2. 🎭 Experience Interop (A2UI)
*   **The Handshake**: The agent brain includes a `surfaceId` in its tool-call metadata.
*   **Implementation**: The `A2UIRegistry` maps these IDs to specific frontend components, enabling the agent to "drive" the UI.
*   **Strategic ROI**: Enables **Push-based GenUI**, where the agent proactively updates the user's viewport.

### 3. 🤝 Reasoning Interop (A2A Evidence Packets)
*   **Surgical State Deltas**: AP2/A2A allows agents to pass only the "delta" of relevant state plus a "Reasoning Trace" packet.
*   **Implementation**: Ensures a LangGraph agent can delegate to a CrewAI agent while maintaining a verifiable audit trail.
*   **Strategic ROI**: Prevents reasoning drift in complex multi-agent swarms.

### 4. 📉 Logic Interop (Sovereign Gateway)
*   **PII Mirroring**: Detecting and scrubbing PII during inter-agent transit using the **Sovereign Gateway** sidecar.
*   **Audit Logic**: Scans for **Self-Referencing Call Cycles** and enforces "Max-Hops" policies.
*   **Strategic ROI**: Prevents **Infinite Spend Loops** and minimizes the "Inter-Agent Tax" on latency.

## 📊 Comparison: Proprietary Silos vs. Sovereign A2X

| Vector | Legacy Bot Silo | v2.0.2 Sovereign A2X |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tools** | Hardcoded REST calls. | **MCP Tool Store Hubs.** |
| **Interface** | Markdown/Text only. | **A2UI Surface-aware GenUI.** |
| **Swarming** | Framework-specific. | **A2A Evidence Packets.** |
| **Governance**| Manual logs. | **Sovereign Gateway sidecar.** |

## 🚀 SME Remediation Strategy

If your ecosystem fails the Interop audit, the SME recommends:
*   **MCP Blueprinting**: Wrap legacy tool logic in an MCP server using `cockpit mcp blueprint`.
*   **Surface Mapping**: Ensure every tool-return statement is mapped to a `surfaceId` in the **A2UI Registry**.
*   **A2A Evidence Packs**: Implement signed reasoning traces for all inter-persona transfers.

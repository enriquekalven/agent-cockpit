# 🚀 Quickstart: Sovereign AgentOps
## The "Sovereign Evolution" (v2.0.2 Stable)

"From `pip install` to `Well-Architected` in 60 seconds."

---

## ⚡ 1. Install & Scaffold

```bash
pip install agentops-cockpit --upgrade
```

### Create a new Sovereign project (A2UI/React/FastAPI)
```bash
cockpit create trinity --name my-sovereign-agent
```
*This instantly scaffolds the **Agentic Trinity**: Engine, Face, and Cockpit.*

---

## ⚙️ 2. The Engine (The Brain)
Build your agent logic in `src/agent_ops_cockpit/agent.py`.
- **Middleware**: Every engine comes with **Sovereign Gateway** logic for PII scrubbing.
- **Grounding**: Wraps reasoning in **Evidence Packets** for multi-agent transparency.

## 🎭 3. The Face (The Interface)
The Face layer uses the **A2UI Protocol** to transform reasoning into rich visual surfaces.
- **Adaptive Surfaces**: UIs that change layout based on logic-layer tool outputs.
- **Thought Visibility**: Real-time streaming of internal "Chains of Thought."

## 🔍 4. The "Aha!" Moment: Your First Audit

```bash
ops report
```
1.  **SME Probing**: Detects your framework and grades it against the **v2.0.2 Governing Board** standards.
2.  **Secret Scanner**: AST-based scan for hardcoded credentials.
3.  **Auto-Remediation**: Run `make apply-fixes` to automatically harden your codebase with **Sovereign SME** advice.

---

## 🛡️ v2.0.2 Governance & Sovereignty
The Cockpit now includes a mandatory **Governing Board** of SMEs:
- **Master SME Personas**: Specialist feedback from SecOps, FinOps, SRE, and Architect Principals.
- **Autonomous Scaffolding**: Automatically logic gates risky tools behind **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)** modals via A2UI.
- **Silent Registry Resilience**: Automatically fails over to public PyPI mirrors if corporate registries are unreachable.

> 🛠️ **Dev Tip**: You can use `ops`, `aops`, or `agent-ops` as aliases for `cockpit`. For example, `ops report` is the preferred way to run a Master Audit.

## 🩺 5. The "Sovereign Doctor"
Before launching a major fleet deployment, verify your cross-cloud credentials:
```bash
ops sys doctor
```
This diagnostic sweep checks your GCP, AWS, and Azure access to ensure zero-failure deployments via the **Sovereign Bridge**.

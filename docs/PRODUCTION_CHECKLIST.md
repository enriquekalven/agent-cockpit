# 🏁 AgentOps Production Readiness Checklist
## The "Sovereign Standard" (v2.0.2 Evolution)

Before moving your agent from "Lab" to "Sovereign Production," ensure you have completed this checklist. This list incorporates standards from the **v2.0.2 Sovereign Technical Guides**.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Sovereign SRE
- [ ] **Secret Governance**: Run `ops report` to verify zero hardcoded tokens or unprotected env files.
- [ ] **Red Team Evaluation**: Run `ops report --mode deep` to verify resistance against multilingual jailbreaks. [**Read Red Team Guide**](TECHNICAL_REDTEAM_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Sovereign Gate**: Ensure CI/CD includes mandatory blocking audit gates (Score > 95 for prod).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Governance
- [ ] **Sovereign Certification**: Run `cockpit certify` (or `make certify`) to verify full production eligibility.
- [ ] **Sovereign Bridge**: Verify that cloud-specific SDKs are abstracted for multi-provider mobility.
- [ ] **Remediation Loop**: Run `make apply-fixes` to autonomously harden the codebase against architectural debt.

## 🧗 Quality & Reasoning
- [ ] **Hill Climbing**: Run `make eval` to baseline reasoning performance against the Persona Radar. [**Read Quality Guide**](TECHNICAL_QUALITY_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Hallucination Scan**: Run `ops report` (RAG Persona) to prove citation fidelity. [**Read Architect Guide**](TECHNICAL_ARCH_REVIEW.md)

## 💰 FinOps & ROI
- [ ] **Reasoning Density**: Verify that quality gains are ROI-positive relative to token spend. [**Read FinOps Guide**](TECHNICAL_FINOPS_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Context Caching**: Enable **Context Caching** for prefix-heavy system instructions.
- [ ] **Smart Routing**: Ensure classification sub-tasks are routed to Flash/Mini models.

## 🎭 UX & GenUI
- [ ] **A2UI Compliance**: Scanned and verified `surfaceId` mapping for all dynamic components. [**Read UX Guide**](TECHNICAL_UX_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Journey Validation**: Run `make smoke-test` to validate full persona user journeys.

## 🚀 The Certification Sequence
1.  **System Sync**: Run `make upgrade` to ensure latest sovereign libraries.
2.  **Master Audit**: Run `make audit` and review the **Sovereign Evidence Lake** partitions.
3.  **Certification**: Run `cockpit certify` to generate the final Production Readiness Badge.

# 🏁 AgentOps Production Readiness Checklist
## The "Autonomous Standard" (v1.3)

Before moving your agent from "Demo" to "Production" on Google Cloud, ensure you have completed this checklist. This list incorporates best practices from the **[Google Well-Architected Framework for Agents](/docs/GOOGLE_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## 🛡️ Security & Adversarial SRE
- [ ] **Secret Governance**: Run `make scan-secrets` to verify zero hardcoded tokens.
- [ ] **Red Team Evaluation**: Run `make red-team` to verify resistance against multilingual jailbreaks and gaslighting. [**Read Red Team Guide**](TECHNICAL_REDTEAM_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Sovereign Gate**: Ensure CI/CD includes mandatory blocking audit gates (Score > 90).

## 🧗 Quality & Reasoning
- [ ] **Hill Climbing**: Run `make quality-baseline` to reach the Global Peak of your prompt's performance. [**Read Quality Guide**](TECHNICAL_QUALITY_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Digital Twin Test**: Run `make simulation-run` to prove reasoning holds up under 100x user load. [**Read Architect Guide**](TECHNICAL_ARCH_REVIEW.md)
- [ ] **Golden Dataset**: Verify performance against the latest versioned Golden Set.

## 💰 FinOps & Optimization
- [ ] **Reasoning Density**: Verify that quality gains are ROI-positive relative to token spend. [**Read FinOps Guide**](TECHNICAL_FINOPS_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Context Caching**: Enable Vertex AI Caching for prefix-heavy system instructions.
- [ ] **Smart Routing**: Ensure non-reasoning sub-tasks are routed to Flash/Mini models.

## 🌐 Infrastructure & SRE
- [ ] **TTFT Monitoring**: Ensure Time to First Token is tracked as the 5th Golden Signal. [**Read Infra Guide**](TECHNICAL_INFRA_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Regional Affinity**: Verify LLM and Vector DB are co-located in the same GCP zone to minimize latency.
- [ ] **Load Test**: Run `make load-test` to empirically measure RPS and TTFT under pressure.

## 🎭 UX & GenUI
- [ ] **A2UI Compliance**: Scanned and verified `surfaceId` mapping for all dynamic components. [**Read UX Guide**](TECHNICAL_UX_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Interactive Journey**: Run `make smoke-test` to validate full persona journeys.

## 🚀 Deployment Standards
1.  **Autonomous Review**: Run `make arch-review` and synthesize fix PRs via `make apply-fixes`.
2.  **Staging Audit**: Run `make audit-deep` on the staging environment.
3.  **Promote**: Use Cloud Run traffic splitting (Canary) for gradual rollout (5% -> 100%).

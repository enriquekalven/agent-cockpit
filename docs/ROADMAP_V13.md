# 🚀 ROADMAP v1.3: The "Autonomous Architect"

This document outlines the 90-day vision to transform the **AgentOps Cockpit** from a "Top of Class" evaluation tool into a **Category Killer** for enterprise AI delivery. We are pivoting from **Passive Evaluation** to **Autonomous Evolution**.

---

## 🏗️ 1. From "Auditor" to "Autonomous Patching"
**Phase: Category Killer v1.3**
The goal is to close the loop between finding a flaw and merging the fix.

*   **v1.3 (Current)**: **Context-Aware Code Synthesis**.
    *   **Logic**: Uses an LLM "Coding Agent" to rewrite the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), ensuring the fix matches the project's specific variable naming, testing patterns, and style (Prettier/Ruff/Black).
    *   **Impact**: Zero-touch architectural evolution.

## 🧪 2. "Digital Twin" Load Testing (`make simulation-run`)
**Phase: Category Killer v1.3**
Consultants use spreadsheets; we use **Synthetic Agent Traffic**.

*   **Logic**: Spins up 100+ "Adversarial User Agents" in a GKE cluster to stress-test the system.
*   **Reasoning Degradation**: Monitors if the agent starts hallucinating or losing context when database latency spikes (Memory Store saturation).
*   **Viral Goal: Adversarial Hallucination Sandbox**: Pre-flight simulation that sends thousands of prompt-injection attempts to a "Shadow" agent to verify safety before production.
*   **Impact**: Proves production stability under real-world multi-turn pressure.

## 🤝 3. Cross-Framework "Bridge" Auditing
**Phase: Category Killer v1.3**
Enterprises rarely use one framework. We provide the **Agent Mesh**.

*   **Logic**: The `InteropAuditor` verifies that your "Agent Mesh" can hand off state across LangChain, CrewAI, and ADK using the **AP2 (Agent Protocol v2)**.
*   **Impact**: Prevents framework lock-in and enables heterogeneous swarms.

## 📊 4. The "Strategic Exit" & TCO Report
**Phase: Category Killer v1.3**
To defeat consultants, we provide the **Exit Strategy**.

*   **Vendor Lock-in TCO**: Every `make arch-review` generates a report calculating the exact cost and lines-of-code required to move from Vertex AI to open-source (e.g., Gemma 2 on GKE).
*   **Impact**: Empowers the CFO with transparent multi-cloud mobility.

## 🌊 5. Impact Waterfall Reporting
**Phase: Category Killer v1.3**
New HTML Executive Export features:

*   **The "Reasoning" Waterfall**: Visualizes latency added by each "hop" in the agent chain between User, Brain, and Data.
*   **The "Risk" Waterfall**: Maps security fixes (Red Team) to "Total Potential Loss" reduction (SOC2/NIST mapping).
*   **Viral Goal: Maturity Radar Charts**: Visualizing the "Agentic Trinity" balance (Engine stability, Face responsiveness, Cockpit governance) for executive review.
*   **Viral Goal: Financial ROI Drift**: Automated alerts when an agent's reasoning density (Performance/Cost) deviates from its historical peak.

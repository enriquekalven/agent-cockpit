# ⌨️ Master Guide: AgentOps UVX Commands
## Portable Governance & Automation (v1.8.2 Stable)

This document provides a consolidated reference for all **`uvx`** commands available in the AgentOps ecosystem. `uvx` allows you to run these tools instantly without a local installation, making them ideal for CI/CD pipelines, ephemeral environments, and auditing external repositories.

The primary package is **`agentops-cockpit`**, which exposes the **`agentops-cockpit`** binary.

| `uvx agentops-cockpit audit security`| **Red Team** | Adversarial security evaluation and credential hygiene. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign`| **Factory** | End-to-End: Audit -> Fix -> Hydrate -> Deploy. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit sys doctor` | **Health Check** | Verify environment paths, GCP Auth, and SDK versions. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit sys certify` | **Certification** | Full Production Readiness Certificate. |

## 🧗 High-Fidelity Filters
Use filters to isolate specific results when running a full report.

```bash
# Run only security and architecture checks
uvx agentops-cockpit audit report --only security --only arch
```

## 🛡️ Registry Resilience & Failover Logic
If you encounter a **401 Unauthorized** error during `uvx`, the Cockpit automatically attempts a **Logic-Based Failover** to Public PyPI.

```bash
# Manual Override:
UV_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.org/simple uvx agentops-cockpit audit report
```

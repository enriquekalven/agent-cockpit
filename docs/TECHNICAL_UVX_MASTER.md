# ⌨️ Master Guide: AgentOps UVX Commands
## Portable Governance & Automation (v1.6.7 Stable)

This document provides a consolidated reference for all **`uvx`** commands available in the AgentOps ecosystem. `uvx` allows you to run these tools instantly without a local installation, making them ideal for CI/CD pipelines, ephemeral environments, and auditing external repositories.

The primary package is **`agentops-cockpit`**, which exposes the **`agentops-cockpit`** binary.

## 🧗 High-Fidelity Filters
Use filters to isolate specific results when running a full report.

```bash
# Run only security and finops checks
uvx agentops-cockpit audit report --only security --only finops

# Skip heavy benchmarks for fast CI feedback
uvx agentops-cockpit audit report --skip quality --skip red-team
```

---

## 🛡️ Registry Resilience & Failover Logic
If you encounter a **401 Unauthorized** error during `uvx`, the Cockpit automatically attempts a **Logic-Based Failover** to Public PyPI.

```bash
# Manual Override:
UV_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.org/simple uvx agentops-cockpit audit report
```

# ⌨️ Master Guide: Sovereign UVX Automation
## Portable Governance & Automation (v2.0.2 Evolution)

This document provides a consolidated reference for all **`uvx`** commands available in the Sovereign ecosystem. `uvx` allows you to run these tools instantly without a local installation, making them ideal for CI/CD pipelines, ephemeral environments, and auditing remote repositories.

The primary package is **`agentops-cockpit`**, which exposes the **`ops`** and **`cockpit`** command surfaces.

## 🏗️ The Sovereign Command Surface (Portable)
We have simplified the command surface into logical hubs for high-fidelity automation.

| Command | Objective | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit ops report` | **Master Audit** | Launch the **Governing Board** (Multi-Persona SME Reasoning). |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit ops report --mode deep` | **Deep Eval** | Iterative Hill Climbing and trajectory analysis. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit ops sys doctor` | **Health Check** | Verify environment paths, multi-cloud auth, and SDK stability. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit cockpit certify` | **Certification** | Generate a Production Readiness Badge for the current project. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit fix evolve` | **Remediation** | Autonomous code hardening via the **Closer Engine**. |

## 🧗 Remote SRE & Fleet Management
Initialize and manage fleets across multi-cloud boundaries using zero-install commands.

| Command | Objective | Key Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit create trinity` | **Scaffolder** | Bootstrap a unified Engine + Face + Cockpit repo. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit fleet status` | **SRE Dashboard** | Live stateful registry of the active agentic estate. |
| `uvx agentops-cockpit deploy sovereign` | **Factory** | End-to-End: Audit -> Fix -> Global Multi-Cloud Deploy. |

## 🛡️ Registry Resilience & Failover Logic
If you encounter a **401 Unauthorized** error during `uvx` (common in restricted VPN environments), the Cockpit automatically attempts a **Path-Based Failover** to public mirrors.

```bash
# Manual Override if needed:
UV_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.org/simple uvx agentops-cockpit ops report
```

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration Example
Add this to your `.github/workflows/sovereign-gate.yml` to enforce the **v2.0.2 Sovereign Standard**:

```yaml
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Sovereign Audit
        run: uvx agentops-cockpit ops report
```
